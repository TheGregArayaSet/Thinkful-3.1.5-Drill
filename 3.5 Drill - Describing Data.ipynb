I chose the mean because there are not any wild outliers that would skew the data, such as an actor who is 18 or something of that nature. I would also pick the standard deviation because it is expressed in the same units as the mean and makes more sense in a common conversation. For example, saying the kids on the show are almost 10 years old on average and tend to vary by about two to three years from that average, would cover almost every age in the list without much of a linguistic hustle."
